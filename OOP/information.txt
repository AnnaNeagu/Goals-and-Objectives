 Abstraction *
    Is like a coffee machine. You know that coffee machine makes coffee, but you don't need to know how it makes coffee.
    All you need to know is about witch button to press to make coffee.    
    In oop abstraction allows you to create seamless programs by just knowing what method to call and what parameters to input.

Encapsulation *
    Using encapsulation can wrapping up of data under a single unit or we keep the data hidden from the outside
    for example someone does the functionality of adding to the database, in this function is the username and password
    and we want them not to be changed or mistakenly overwritten
    thus we create a capsule that delimits the inside from the outside

Inheritance *
    Allows classes to take properties from other classes or allow extension from parent to child class.
    For example we have a class of vehicles and two other classes of children cars and trucks
    these two have common properties and specific properties

Polymorphism  
    Copy of the same method that may receive different input
    For example when we have a product application and we want to search for a product by name or by a code
    We create a function for the name and one for the code which will be the same, just different inputs
    but each will return the same thing 
    Polymorphism meaning many forms: 
     1. Inheritance 
     2. Duck-Typing = operations on the class of an object
